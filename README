blacklight_ext_ead_simple
=========================

This is a simplistic plugin for indexing and viewing EAD XML from within
a Blacklight Rails application.


Installation
=======

Create a new application which installs Blacklight and blacklight_ext_ead_simple:

rails ./blacklight-app-ead -m http://github.com/jronallo/blacklight_ext_ead_simple/raw/master/template.rb

Into an existing Rails application:

rake rails:template LOCATION=http://github.com/jronallo/blacklight_ext_ead_simple/raw/master/template.rb


Index your own EAD XML
=======

rake solr:index:ead_dir FILE=/path/to/ead/directory/*


Limitations / Known Issues
=======

* Does not handle every possible tag, attribute and permutation of EAD XML.
* Can only handle numbered component parts of the collection inventory. The EAD
  will be indexed and searchable, but the inventory will not display.
* Lacks tests.
